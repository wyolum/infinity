# infinity
Circular infinity Mirror project using addressable LED's

Edit the SCAD file to output the individual layers, or use as is.

The default settings are for a 60 LED/meter strip.
The thickness of the material in the middle (where the strip is attached) will determine how many layers you need. For some cheap 1/4" home depot plywood, I used two layers and supplemented with one layer of 3mm acrylic for WS2812 strip.

There's also a back plate with space for an Arduino Pro Micro (clone). I think it's a good idea to put something over the mirror layer to prevent scratching.
